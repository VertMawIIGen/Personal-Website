## Well, this is my personal (skilltest) website.

Nothing **special** here. Apparently it looks like it's from the 90s. And frankly I couldn't agree more.

Things I should do:
 - [x] Fix the scrolling function.
 - [x] Change the homepage image.
 - [x] Change the color scheme (The 1990s vibe won't cut it).
 - [x] Fix the navbar.
 - [x] Fix scaling (well, partially at least).
 - [ ] Add the information.
 - [ ] Add more sections.
 - [ ] Make the navbar actually functional.
 - [ ] Make website more aesthetic?
